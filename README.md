  - Enabling multiple clients to use the system simultaneously while maintaining a consistent view from the Server
  - Authenticating users through Login & Signup

	- JGroups
  - Client
	- Server
	- Api-Gateway

# How to run the Project: (to be contd...)
  - Clone the Project
  - Explain the Folder Structure

  - How to Compile from the Client Side
  - How to Compiel from the Server Side

  - Run Multiple Single/Multiple instances of the Api-Gateway Class (...)
  - Running the Local RmiRegistry For the Client to be able to Connect with the Api-Gateway, etc...

# Project ScreenShoots: (to be contd...)
  - Available Functionalities
	- Killing Servers + Api-Gateways + Fault Tolerance
